# fix-packaging-OA

To the authors: this is a great guide! I've been learning how
to get sphinx to produce documentation and it's working great!

The section entitled **Setting up ReadTheDocs** contains some
code for the ``.readthedocs.yml`` file to be used when setting
up the ReadTheDocs documentation.

However, it seems there is a problem with the indentation in
the example provided, and when I tried to build the file using
this I ran into a set of compilation errors.

I made a fix to the in the ``docs/docs.rst`` file and this now
compiles OK.

Hopefully this can help people using the guide!

Cheers,

Alex
